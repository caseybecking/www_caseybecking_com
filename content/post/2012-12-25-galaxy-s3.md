So I got my Galaxy S3 and returned my iPhone 5. I've had all the iPhones from OG -> 3G -> 4 -> 5. I loved them up until I got the iPhone 5. It didn't change enough for me, it was kind of standard and not exciting. It was fast and the camera was nice but other than that it didn't blow me away. So I went and got the Galaxy S3 and love it, ended up liking it more than I really thought I would. My wife started messing with it and got her self one as well. Few issues I am having with the transition is the slow typing of the keyboard and all I use is the voice feature for the keyboard. Other than that I love the new phone.
