So I've been using Jekyll for a few months now with this blog and other little platforms here and there. I have to say I'm amazingly impressed on how easy it is to write a blog post and get it posted and up on a server on the web. Back in the day of wordpress days i used to have to log into WordPress go author the post, right all of the HTML markup, preview the post and then if everything worked out cleanly I was able to post it to my site. With Jekyll I am able to write a post locally on my machine in markdown, view it locally before even pushing it up to a server and then once I'm all done all I have to do is committed to github and it posts to my blog. I love how simple it has become.
