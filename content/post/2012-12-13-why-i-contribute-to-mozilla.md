By far the most important thing I’ve learned in my career is knowledge. I’m able to expand on the knowledge that I have learned by contributing to the open source community and letting other people critique my code in ways that I had never thought I could do before. At first this might be a little bit scary, having someone look through your code and critique every , . & and function but it’s the best thing that’s ever happened to my code. The team at Mozilla doesn’t put you down for writing code that isn’t perfect. They give you information to lead you in the right direction about how to write the code the best way possible. There doesn’t seem to be arrogance at Mozilla at all. If you’re looking to start with web development bugs filed at Mozilla check out – <http=//www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/> . I was once again lucky enough to be able to contribute to this project and it’s a great place to start working with the open-source community.
