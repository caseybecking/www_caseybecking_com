description = ["I've had the privilege of working with Casey over the past two years and witnessed his growth as both an AWS focused engineer and a developer. In this time he's become one of the most knowledgeable and skilled engineers in the field, with his most recent work helping to significantly drive down the time for delivery of new environments to Customers. His ability to adapt and learn quickly with new problems has been shown time and time again. Casey would be an amazing addition to any organization and I highly recommend him."]
