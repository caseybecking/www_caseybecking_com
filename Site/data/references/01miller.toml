description = ["Casey is a bilingual eCommerce Ninja--speaking both technical and business languages, cutting thru hype, to outline reality.  I’ve had the pleasure of collaborating with Casey on several projects while at Volcom and Kering.  His professionalism, dedication (working at all hours), and commitment went above and beyond; ensuring that his team executed and completed projects on time and on budget.  He is a RARE find in the eCommerce space with his ability to help business leaders understand technology implications; ensuring all projects are prioritized and executed accordingly.  Much of our success at Volcom can be attributed to Casey’s talents in managing people, platforms, and process flows.   In short, he’s a catalyst to growth and a unique asset to any organization."]
