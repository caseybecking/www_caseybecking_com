description = ["Casey is an outstanding example of what a remote employee should strive to be.  Highly communicative, very productive, stays involved in team communications, and as a direct manager never had to question his availability in the 2 years I was lucky enough to work with him.  As an engineer, Casey is highly customer focused, is a sponge for learning new technologies quickly, and extremely detail oriented.  He was constantly given tougher workloads and customers because of his innate ability to handle them with ease, understand business and technical requirements, and complete them on time and with a high degree of quality.  Any organization, team, and leader would be lucky to have a Casey on their bench!"]
