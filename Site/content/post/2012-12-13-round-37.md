I’m gonna give this another try at staying on top of it. I’m going to be posting often and see how long I can keep it going. Sorry for the forever long delay. I’m also not going to be using this site to display my portfolio. If you care to see all the junk I’ve worked on goto my [GitHub](http://github.com/caseybecking) page and check out some stuff there. Also i have removed all my old posts and am going to start fresh!
