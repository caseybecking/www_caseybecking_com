once again I'm going to try to keep a daily digest of what is going on in my day what I'm working on and what I would like to be working on. this may be very random at times but it also may be very insightful to look back in a significant amount of time to be able to figure out what I was working on.I will also try to  format these overtime to make them more readable and less like a diary.But as for today here goes.



This past weekend was spent with the family primarily we went and saw a movie. on Saturday night I play hockey and won. On Sunday morning I went to breakfast with my father.
