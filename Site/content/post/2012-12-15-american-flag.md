So I was asked as a part of an interview to 'Make an American flag with Html/CSS'. First thing that poped into my head that this is an amazing quiz. Next thing is damn I have to do this on a white board with a dry-erase marker. So heres what I came up with. [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/caseybecking/MQSg7/). Let me know what you think.
