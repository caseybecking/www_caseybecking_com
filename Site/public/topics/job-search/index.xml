      <description>Make it your day job to find a job So right now I find my self looking for a new full time employment opportunity. I wanted to take some time to jot down how I&amp;rsquo;m doing this and how I think people should handle the opportunity that is present ed to them of being unemployed
I&amp;rsquo;m a very early morning person I wake between 3-4am almost daily (weekends closer to 5) I go to the gym to get out of the house and go do something right when I wake up.</description>
