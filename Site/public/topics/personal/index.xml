      <description>What have I been doing in the past 2 years since my last post. A TON!!
Professional Build Engineer I became a build engineer in early 2017. As a build engineer the basic outline of the job is to take Design Documents and build out infrastructure. This could have been done via a command line interface or via an automation tool (Terraform or [Cloudformation] (https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-templates/) templates). We spent time discussing with the customer their needs and wants as well as current architecture.</description>
