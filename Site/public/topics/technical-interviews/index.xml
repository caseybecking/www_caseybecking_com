      <description>Be Prepared - Be sure to bring not only your resume but any additional things that you think you will need for the interview. Bring a notebook with a pen to be able to write down notes as well during the meeting it shows that you&amp;rsquo;re paying attention and if anything comes up it is always nice to be able to write it down as a note to go back later and research it.</description>
