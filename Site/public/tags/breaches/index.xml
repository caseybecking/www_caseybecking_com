      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s no denying that E-commerce has grown at an enormous rate in the last decade.  For many companies, eCommerce has quickly become the fastest growing channel; if not the largest channel of sales.    Yet sadly, with growth, come those who’d also like to profit from the hundreds of thousands of unprotected sites, ripe with personal data and payment details.   Successful ecommerce platforms, such as Magento with 200,000+ installs, makes for a ripe target for the savvy hacker.   Daily attempts to intrude payment processes, gain access to data bases, etc. allows them to resell personal data and/or take a cut of the transaction, which can certainly provide a luxurious living for hackers.
These malicious elements try to penetrate e-commerce sites to get to merchant accounts.  More often than not, it’s a door or window that’s left open; where a company has failed to install a security update, used soft usernames, or simply bad programming.   Once successful, the hacker downloads your customer’s personal information. (Username, Address, Payment details, etc).   eCommerce hackers are mostly after CC data, user data, and access to payment gateway details so they can shave pennies/dollars off of orders without the company knowing.   In 80% of the cases we’ve seen, these compromised sites aren’t aware of the breach for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, there are signs that your e-commerce site has been breached.
They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your payment gateway uses Address Verification System (AVS) and Card Security Codes, where the transaction does not contain any AVS or CVV2/CVC2 requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Site speed and page load performance during checkout. (common when your checkout is now being asked to make an add’l call, per the hacker’s design.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the transaction does not include any Customer Identification Information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are several transactions within a really short period on your magneto platform or any other ecommerce platform you operate on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat User ID access to the database at odd hours.  (often it’s a valid username &amp;amp; password)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offset the balances when reconciling transactions at the end of the month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suspicious multiple transactions from the same IP (Internet Protocol) address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve have experienced any of these signs, simply take these five steps to assist in the recovery of your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take your website offline
You should tentatively shut the site down while it is being assessed and fixed.  Stop the bleeding!  For example, adding a text file named “maintenance.flag” to the web root of a Magento-based site will put the site into maintenance mode and display a 503 service unavailable message to site visitors.
(We strongly recommend customizing the 503 message, offering customers a phone number to call if they have questions about an order or even posting a discount code for free shipping when the site comes back up.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 . Change all passwords and control access going forward
Despite warnings, soft passwords are still commonplace and result in site hacks.   Take the time to review all user accounts, access levels, permissions, etc. and close off any potential vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scan your local computers for viruses and malware
You will need to scan your entire environment and touch points to 3rd party solutions with an anti-virus software to ensure the are not infected with malware, Trojan, spyware, etc. Be sure your anti-virus software is up-to-date before using it to scan your computer.
If you’re running Magento code, you’re in luck, you can conduct a free scan of your code base at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sekursite.com/site-scan/&#34;&gt;https://www.sekursite.com/site-scan/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clean up the site
With the help of a security minded developer, systems integrator, or consultancy, you might be able to discover the malicious code affecting your site.   Delete all code found and refresh with a clean installation from a backup and manually check all plugin folders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notify your ecommerce software provider.
Yes, getting hacked can be embarrassing, painful, and emotional.  Yet, now is your chance to spread the word and help others.   If you remain silent, software vendors will go on believing that their code bases have “never been hacked” and other industry peers using that code base will certainly fall victim to the same scan.   Once successful many hackers will simply ‘rinse &amp;amp; repeat’, deploying their code to other sites on the same platform by exploiting the same holes found on your site.   Contact your software provider pronto!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel your site has been compromised or you’d like to test your site’s security, don’t hesitate to take a free scan today. Click &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sekursite.com/site-scan/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; Let them find the holes in your site before someone else does.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Biggest Data Breaches of 2015</title>
      <link>http://www.caseybecking.com/post/2016-08-30-biggest-data-breaches-of-2015/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2014 was certainly a big year for data breaches; impacting the likes of Adobe, Apple, Evernote, eBay, and Facebook….to name a few of the headliners.    As 2015 came to a close, we saw even more breaches, hitting the likes of industries like health-care, financial, education, federal government, and eCommerce.    While the threat of cyber security increases, the good news is that we’re seeing more and more companies getting educated, taking action, and making increased investments in both security technologies and people (CSO), for which to manage threats.
Let’s take a look at the top data breaches of 2015:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ashley Madison- While not the largest breach on the list this year, Ashley Madison certainly got a lot of press, bringing up uncomfortable discussions w/in many relationships as those cheaters were exposed publicly.  Unfortunately the outing had many negative consequences from divorce, separation, and even death as a few Ashley Madison customers took their lives over the shame and emotional distress.   In the end, over 37 million customer records were exposed.  Making matters worse, other less scrupulous types then used the public personal data to then blackmail users for bitcoin payments.  In short, things got way ugly and fast.    The hacker group, calling themselves The Impact Team succeeded in their goal of decimating Ashley Madison’s business model as the company has struggled to regain customer trust, despite the companies position of “all is well”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BlueCross BlueShield – In two different hacks targeting the heath care provider in 2015, over 12 million subscribers, as well as some individuals who do business with the company, found their personal information had been stolen.  The breach compromised subscriber data, which includes names, birth dates, Social Security numbers (11.2 Million SSNs), bank account information, addresses and other information.   One of the breaches (CareFirst/BlueCross) was discovered as part of a 3rd party security review that found hackers had gained access to a database that members use to get access to the company&amp;rsquo;s website and services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-Bank Cyber Heist- In February, over 100+ banks around the world discovered they’d been breached and over $1Billion in funds had been stolen.  (Yes, $1 Billion).  Kaspersky Lab, a Moscow based security firm, discovered that the banks’ networks had been breached via common phishing tactics, allowing hackers to gain access to employee account credentials and key systems. The cybercriminal ring, calling themselves  ‘Carbanak’, then used those credentials to make fraudulent transfers and hijacked ATM machines as they funneled more than $1 billion into their own offshore accounts.  While initial attacks were first detected as early as December 2013, the activity continued to ramp up until ultimately being shut down in April of 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US Government- Office of Personnel Management- Easily one of the largest and most brazen cyber attacks in history, a whopping 25.7 Million federal workers found their personal information had been stolen.  What was initially reported as a breach affecting 4.2 million individuals, later spiraled into another separate attack affecting 21.5 million records.   While the perpetrators and their methods have yet to be divulged to the public, we do know that they first accessed the US government databases as early as March 2014.    Therefore, for over a year these hackers (reportedly traced back to China) walked away with personally identifiable information such as Social Security numbers, as well as names, dates and places of birth, and addresses.  The hack went deeper than initially believed and likely involved theft of detailed security-clearance-related background information as well.  The breach resulted in the resignation of the Director of the OPM, in addition to a $23Million online and mail campaign to help those affected ensure their compromised data wasn’t already being used.   So yes, tax payers just paid for a campaign that’s likely to have zero effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above hacks and data breaches were targeted with different intentions in mind.  Some were breached with the goal of accessing credit card information and some were hacked just for the sake of pride or revenge, as in the case of Ashley Madison.   Regardless of intent, one thing they all have in common is that hackers were almost always in their systems, unchecked, for over 12+ months on average.    Without an increased eye on security, hackers have plenty of time to kick back and work some magic with your customer’s personal data.

      <title>But I run Magento.  I’m small.  Why would I get hacked?</title>
      <link>http://www.caseybecking.com/post/but-i-run-magento/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2016 17:39:47 -0700</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After working with many small and mid-sized retailers in 2015, there is one thing they all have in common—the assumption that hackers won’t bother with them.   Actually it’s the reverse - criminals have figured out small companies are easier to penetrate, and go after them more frequently.  Why go for one big hack, of say eBay or Facebook,  when you can hack 5,000+ sites which NEVER take notice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of high-profile hacks such as against Apple, Cisco, or even the US Government, many online retailers still do not believe that they are at risk or have been a victim of undetected hacks by criminal groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www2.trustwave.com/rs/815-RFM-693/images/2015_TrustwaveGlobalSecurityReport.pdf&#34;&gt;2015 Trustwave Global Security Report&lt;/a&gt;, retail was the top industry compromised, making up 41% of the attacks investigated. And 65% of those attacks were against e-commerce sites, where hackers target servers and databases that host card data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s all put our &lt;em&gt;criminal hat&lt;/em&gt; on for a second and think about things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PII (personally identifiable  information) is GOLD to a hacker.  It trades easy on the black market (dark web) and it’s value increases with more in-depth profiles such as username/pw, CC details, address, bill to, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who has PII data readily available?  Online retailers!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals are highly skilled technically and are also business people, who know how to make money. A recent CNN article said this: “According to one European intelligence service, there are 20-30 criminal gangs in the former Soviet Union that have hacking skills as good as most nations. There are many other groups with lesser skills. These criminals are nimble and inventive, and there are thriving cybercrime black markets where you can buy the latest hacking tools.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent Javelin Strategy &amp;amp; Research report found that financial institutions are doing a much better job than retailers when it comes to credit card security. Indeed, there are a number of online marketplaces and forums that solely exist to sell information gained by hackers, for example Rescator.la sells stolen credit and debit card information. In such places, customer databases from online stores are often the most expensive on the black market, because they contain correct, up-to-date and complete customer details, sometimes even with their credit card numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completeness is a very important factor for pricing on the black market. One customer record from an online store may generate a penny, while a thousand records can easily generate at least $10, or much more, depending on the records’ quality and completeness. For example spammers prefer to purchase e-mails from Internet retailers, simply because they will get a higher click-through rate, generating more revenue, as they can send targeted spam (by country, age, wealth, area of interests, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers are also interested in the valuable information on shoppers’ computers, so e-commerce web sites are often infected with malware (an exploit pack targeting and exploiting vulnerabilities in Adobe products or popular browsers). Such attacks often remain unnoticed as they are conducted overnight or at weekends when security team is away. Experienced hackers can go undetected over a long period. For example, French computer hardware retailer LaCie disclosed in April 2014 that its web site had been breached by a malware attack that went undetected for a year. Following the breach, the retailer recommended that buyers check their credit card statements for any fraudulent charges, and keep an eye on their credit reports in case of identity theft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big-name breaches that hit headlines leave many small and midsized e-business owners believing that they will not be attacked, assuming their customer databases are not big enough. This assumption is wrong because in the majority of cases hackers are not looking for customers and data from a specific web shop, they are just looking for commercially exploitable data. The more, the better. It’s much easier, faster and cheaper to hack 50 small e-boutiques than hacking one big one. Moreover, the outcome in terms of number of stolen customer records will be almost the same, probably even bigger. Imagine how much it costs to compromise Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large e-commerce retailers also have much more administrative, financial and legal resources to organize forensics and post-incident investigation, so many hackers try to avoid them. Instead, they often target small retailers that have no capability to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As only a small number of Black Hats have the necessary skills, time and resources to launch attacks against the biggest players in the e-commerce industry, hackers prefer to compromise a dozen small and medium online shops per day and get their money on the “every little bit helps” principle. Hacker groups use robots, hidden behind proxies, to crawl the Web in the 24/7/365 mode. They look for known vulnerabilities, outdated versions of web application software or just brute force default or weak passwords. One would be surprised how much information can be just found in Google. And if you have a crawling farm you can compromise thousands of web sites per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this hacker onslaught, online retailers of all sizes need to employ an arsenal that is as flexible and up to date as the hackers’ tools. Retailers need to ensure that their hosting providers or data centers have stringent security procedures, that content management systems are up to date, third-party code is checked thoroughly before use and web sites are regularly audited for weaknesses through a combination of vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.&lt;/p&gt;
